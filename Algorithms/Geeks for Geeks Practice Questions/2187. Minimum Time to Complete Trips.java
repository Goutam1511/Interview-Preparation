/*
You are given an array time where time[i] denotes the time taken by the ith bus to complete one trip.
Each bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip.
Also, each bus operates independently; that is, the trips of one bus do not influence the trips of any other bus.
You are also given an integer totalTrips, which denotes the number of trips all buses should make in total.
Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least totalTrips trips.

Example 1:

Input: time = [1,2,3], totalTrips = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.
- At time t = 3, the number of trips completed by each bus are [3,1,1]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.
So the minimum time needed for all buses to complete at least 5 trips is 3.
Example 2:

Input: time = [2], totalTrips = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is only one bus, and it will complete its first trip at t = 2.
So the minimum time needed to complete 1 trip is 2.

Constraints:

1 <= time.length <= 10^5
1 <= time[i], totalTrips <= 10^7

Solution : Problem is same as Aggressive Cows where we binary search for the right time. The maximum time that will take to complete totalTrips is if
the slowest bus completes all the trips and the minimum time is 0. The right time lies somewhere in between hence we binary search and check all middle
points, if middle point time happens to be sufficient to complete the given totalTrips then we search for a lower time. We check if totalTrips can be
completed by dividing the time we are checking by each bus time - that particular bus can complete that many trips within the defined time and we keep 
on summing this number to find out the number of trips in total that can be completed within the defined time.

Time Complexity : O(nlogn)
Space Complexity : O(1)
