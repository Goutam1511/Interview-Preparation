/*
You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.
The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.

For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
We return the new list after removing this node. 
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
Example 3:

Input: head = [2,1]
Output: [2]
Explanation:
The above figure represents the given linked list.
For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 10^5].
1 <= Node.val <= 10^5

Solution : Fast & Slow pointer approach with a previous pointer trailing the slow pointer to reconnect the linked list properly after deleting the middle node.
We also have to keep in mind the even and odd number of node cases.

Edge Case : 1. Linked List with only one node. 2. Linked List with even nodes 3. Linked List with odd nodes.

Time Complexity : O(n) Space : O(1)
