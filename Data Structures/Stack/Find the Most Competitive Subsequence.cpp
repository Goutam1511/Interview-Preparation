/*
Given an integer array nums and a positive integer k, return the most competitive subsequence of nums of size k.
An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.
We define that a subsequence a is more competitive than a subsequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ,
subsequence a has a number less than the corresponding number in b. For example, [1,3,4] is more competitive than [1,3,5] because the first 
position they differ is at the final number, and 4 is less than 5.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
Output: [2,6]
Explanation: Among the set of every possible subsequence: {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6], k = 4
Output: [2,3,3,4]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= nums[i] <= 109
1 <= k <= nums.length

Solution : Use stack to build a monotonic increasing subsequence while iterating from left to right. For doing that while iterating, in case we hit a number
that is lesser than the numbers already on stack, we start popping the greater numbers from stack. However, since we are building a subsequence of size k, we
need to always have at least k numbers in stack and hence we can pop only (nums.size() - k) numbers atmost.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> mostCompetitive(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<int> stack;
        int nums_to_delete = nums.size()-k;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            while (!stack.empty() && nums[i] < stack.back() && nums_to_delete) {
                stack.pop_back();
                nums_to_delete--;
            }
            stack.push_back(nums[i]);
        }
        return vector<int>(stack.begin(), stack.begin()+k);
    }
};
